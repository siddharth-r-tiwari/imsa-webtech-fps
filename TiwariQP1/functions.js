  The javascript file conttains many different functions, but all of them revolve around the availability of the cars.
  I use a RNG to come up with the cars that will available and unavailable. From this, the numerous other functions are
  able to run. This random number generation makes this page more realistic and complicated to program because some
  values become extraneous.
